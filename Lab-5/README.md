# Experiment 4

### 1) For M-tap moving average filter, plot the magnitude and phase response for different values of M using MATLAB.
### Note: Use inbuilt function: freqz.

### 2)  Write a MATLAB program to generate a signal x(n)=2n (0.95) n ; 0≤n≤99. Corrupt it by additive random noise with amplitude in interval [-0.5 0.5]. Apply the signal to a Moving average filter with given tap length. Plot the input signal,noise signal, corrupted signal and filtered signal in same plot. Use proper labels and legends.
### Note: Use inbuilt functions: rand, filter
