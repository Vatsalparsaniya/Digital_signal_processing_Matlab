# Lab-3
## Experiment 2

(i)	Find rational Transfer function H(z) = B(z)/A(z) of given DT LTI systems analytically. 

(ii)	Write a MATLAB program to find and plot pole-zero pattern in z-plane, to determine stability, to find and plot unit impulse and unit step responses, to find and plot magnitude and phase responses (Frequency response plots)  if the given system is stable.

## Note: Use inbuilt functions: tf2zpk, zplane, isstable, impz, freqz.
